# mandelbrot-viewer

A viewer for the mandelbrot set [http://theoutliar.github.io/mandelbrot-viewer/](http://theoutliar.github.io/mandelbrot-viewer/)

Each coordinate in Real (‚Ñù) space represents the components of a complex number.

The colorization is achieved by testing whether the iterative application of a certain function to those components results in divergence from particular boundaries.

If a certain number of iterative tests fails to result in divergence, we can conclude it's "close enough" to represent a member of the set for a given zoom level, and color it black.

If we've determined the iterative application of the function results in divergence, we color according to modulus division of the number of iterations that took against the length of a given color palette. In this case, üåàs.
